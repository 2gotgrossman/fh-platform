# â›± Florida Hackers Site

Hi there! This is where the source for the [Florida Hackers Site](http://floridahackers.com) lives. The site serves as a hub to find the different places where the Florida college tech community can connect with each other, as well as a calendar to find past and upcoming events coming up in Florida. 

## Adding your own event

_coming soon_


## Development

To run the site in development mode, you'll need node installed. Then simply open up a terminal and run this command to start up a server in development mode at `http://localhost:8080/`

```
npm run start
```

##### Production build

To generate an optimized, production ready build, simply run 
```
npm run build
```
and you'll see the generated files under the `public/dist` directory.

*Happy Hacking!*
